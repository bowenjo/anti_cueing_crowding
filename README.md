# anti_cueing_crowding
Code for running an anti-cueing experimental task for testing the effects of endogenous and exogenous attention on visual crowding and ensemble perception.

## Running a experiment
The framework was used to build a number of attention-cueing experiments. 
1. **main.m** was designed to test the effects of exogenous and endogenous spatial attention on the critical spacing of visual crowding
2. **ensemble_main.m** was designed to test the effects the precision (cue size) of exogenous spatial attention on crowding and ensemble perception
3. **uniform_main.m** same as above but on a uniform stimulus array
